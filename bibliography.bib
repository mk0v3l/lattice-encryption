  abstract = {The advent of quantum computing threatens to break many classical
              cryptographic schemes, leading to innovations in public key
              cryptography that focus on post-quantum cryptography primitives and
              protocols resistant to quantum computing threats. Lattice-based
              cryptography is a promising post-quantum cryptography family, both
              in terms of foundational properties as well as in its application
              to both traditional and emerging security problems such as
              encryption, digital signature, key exchange, and homomorphic
              encryption. While such techniques provide guarantees, in theory,
              their realization on contemporary computing platforms requires
              careful design choices and tradeoffs to manage both the diversity
              of computing platforms (e.g., high-performance to resource
              constrained), as well as the agility for deployment in the face of
              emerging and changing standards. In this work, we survey trends in
              lattice-based cryptographic schemes, some recent fundamental
              proposals for the use of lattices in computer security, challenges
              for their implementation in software and hardware, and emerging
              needs for their adoption. The survey means to be informative about
              the math to allow the reader to focus on the mechanics of the
              computation ultimately needed for mapping schemes on existing
              hardware or synthesizing part or all of a scheme on special-purpose

  abstract = {Legacy encryption systems depend on sharing a key (public or
              private) among the peers involved in exchanging an encrypted
              message. However, this approach poses privacy concerns. The users
              or service providers with the key have exclusive rights on the
              data. Especially with popular cloud services, control over the
              privacy of the sensitive data is lost. Even when the keys are not
              shared, the encrypted material is shared with a third party that
              does not necessarily need to access the content. Moreover,
              untrusted servers, providers, and cloud operators can keep
              identifying elements of users long after users end the relationship
              with the services. Indeed, Homomorphic Encryption (HE), a special
              kind of encryption scheme, can address these concerns as it allows
              any third party to operate on the encrypted data without decrypting
              it in advance. Although this extremely useful feature of the HE
              scheme has been known for over 30 years, the first plausible and
              achievable Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) scheme, which allows
              any computable function to perform on the encrypted data, was
              introduced by Craig Gentry in 2009. Even though this was a major
              achievement, different implementations so far demonstrated that FHE
              still needs to be improved significantly to be practical on every
              platform. Therefore, this survey focuses on HE and FHE schemes.
              First, we present the basics of HE and the details of the
              well-known Partially Homomorphic Encryption (PHE) and Somewhat
              Homomorphic Encryption (SWHE), which are important pillars for
              achieving FHE. Then, the main FHE families, which have become the
              base for the other follow-up FHE schemes, are presented.
              Furthermore, the implementations and recent improvements in
              Gentry-type FHE schemes are also surveyed. Finally, further
              research directions are discussed. This survey is intended to give
              a clear knowledge and foundation to researchers and practitioners
              interested in knowing, applying, and extending the state-of-the-art
              HE, PHE, SWHE, and FHE systems.},

              while retaining confidentiality of the training and test data.
              Since the computational complexity of the homomorphic encryption
              scheme depends primarily on the number of levels of multiplications
              to be carried out on the encrypted data, we define a new class of
              machine learning algorithms in which the algorithm's predictions,
              viewed as functions of the input data, can be expressed as
              polynomials of bounded degree. We propose confidential algorithms
              for binary classification based on polynomial approximations to
              least-squares solutions obtained by a small number of gradient
              descent steps. We present experimental validation of the

  abstract = {We propose a fully homomorphic encryption scheme -- i.e., a scheme
              that allows one to evaluate circuits over encrypted data without
              being able to decrypt. Our solution comes in three steps. First, we
              provide a general result -- that, to construct an encryption scheme
              that permits evaluation of arbitrary circuits, it suffices to
              construct an encryption scheme that can evaluate (slightly
              augmented versions of) its own decryption circuit; we call a scheme
              that can evaluate its (augmented) decryption circuit
              bootstrappable.Next, we describe a public key encryption scheme
              using ideal lattices that is almost bootstrappable.Lattice-based
              cryptosystems typically have decryption algorithms with low circuit
              complexity, often dominated by an inner product computation that is
              in NC1. Also, ideal lattices provide both additive and
              multiplicative homomorphisms (modulo a public-key ideal in a
              polynomial ring that is represented as a lattice), as needed to
              evaluate general circuits.Unfortunately, our initial scheme is not
              quite bootstrappable -- i.e., the depth that the scheme can
              correctly evaluate can be logarithmic in the lattice dimension,
              just like the depth of the decryption circuit, but the latter is
              greater than the former. In the final step, we show how to modify
              the scheme to reduce the depth of the decryption circuit, and
              thereby obtain a bootstrappable encryption scheme, without reducing
              the depth that the scheme can evaluate. Abstractly, we accomplish
              this by enabling the encrypter to start the decryption process,
              leaving less work for the decrypter, much like the server leaves
              less work for the decrypter in a server-aided cryptosystem.},
