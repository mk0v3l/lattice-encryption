\section{\label{sec:subj}Subject}
Nowadays, the security of our data is a major concern. With the rise of quantum computers,
the security of our data is at risk. We need to find new ways to encrypt our data.
Moreover, we need to be able to perform operations on encrypted data. This is where
homomorphic encryption comes in.
As seen in the course, lattice-based encryption is a good candidate homomorphic encryption,
and it turns out that it is also a good candidate for post-quantum encryption.
In this project, we will study lattice-based encryption and its applications.

\section{\label{sec:Plan}Plan}
We plan to study : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Why do we need post quantum and homomorphic encryption ? (Mickael)
    \item What is lattice scheme encryption ? (Patrick)
    \item Why is it a good candidate for post quantum encryption and homomorphic encryption ? (Mickael)
    \item How does it work ? (Patrick)
    \item What applications can we find for this encryption ? (Simon)
      \item Implement some examples of lattice scheme encryption to compare with the 
        results of the paper.(Dan)
\end{itemize}
